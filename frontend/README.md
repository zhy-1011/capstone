# Frontend

This directory will host the user-facing frontend of the cognitive guide system. It will contain the web or mobile UI components that interact with the backend services to guide entrepreneurs through the AI-driven ideation and evaluation process.

The frontend may include:

- A dashboard for users to view and manage their projects and progress.
- Interfaces for answering guided questions posed by the AI agent and viewing feedback.
- Community pages for sharing projects, reviewing othersâ€™ ideas, and engaging with investors.

Implementation details (frameworks, build tools, deployment) can be added here as the project evolves.

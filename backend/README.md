# Backend

This directory contains the backend services of the cognitive guide system.

Key components:

- **AI-guided agent**: Simulates an experienced mentor to ask probing questions and provide feedback.
- **Project state tracking system**: Records the user's thinking process and visualizes the evolution of ideas.
- **Community and investor platform**: Manages project sharing, peer evaluation, and investor discovery.

Each backend module (agent, tracking, community) resides in its own subdirectory under this folder.
